# 🧠 Machine Learning Journey in Python

Welcome to my personal journey of learning Machine Learning with Python — one project, one concept at a time.

This repo is structured to:
- Explore ML concepts from scratch
- Practice Python fundamentals (loops, functions, classes, etc.)
- Learn and use Git, terminal, and basic project management tools

---

## 🧰 Tools & Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib
- Git & GitHub
- Cursor (as my coding environment)
